  <p><h3>Switch vs If/Else</h3></p>

<p>Switch and if/else statements generally serve the same purpose by checking
for conditions prior to executing code. If/else statements are much more common;
however, a switch statement is a lot cleaner when there are a lot of different
conditions (or cases) to choose from. For example, if we wanted to print
someone’s horoscope, we could write twelve separate if/else statements (which
would involve a lot of repetitive code) or we could use one switch statement
with twelve cases.</p>

<p><h3>Equals, Equals, Equals</h3></p>
<p><ul>
  <li> <strong>=</strong> assigns value to a variable. For example, we might write int x; x = 5
    which tells us that the integer x has been assigned the value of 5.</li>

  <li> <strong>==</strong> is an operator that compares the locations (or references) of
    objects </li>

  <li> <strong>.equals</strong> is a method and it compares values of variables. The .equals
    method can be used to compare Strings while the == operator cannot.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>Casting</h3></p>

<p>“Casting a double to an int” refers to converting a number that includes a
decimal (the double) into a whole number (integer).  In order to do this, we
type “(int)” in front of the double that needs to be converted. The “(int)”
rounds the double value down to the nearest integer. Another way to think about
this is that the “(int)” strips away all the numbers to the right of the decimal
point, leaving just the integer to the left. An example might look like this:</p>

	<p class="indented">   System.out.println( (int)(7.97283)</p>

<p>When run, this will return “7”.</p>

<p>Casting a double to an int can be used to write a simulated a dice game. In such
a program, we would use</p>

<p class="indented">   Math.random()</p>

<p>to generate a random number between 0.0 and 0.9999999…(almost but never
  quite 1.0) . We then multiply that value by 6 which gives a random number
  between 0.0 and 5.9999999… . </p>

<p class="indented">   ( Math.random() ) * 6</p>

<p>Since a die only has possible whole number values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we
then need to cast the value to an integer.</p>

<p class="indented">   (int) ( ( Math.random() ) * 6 )</p>

<p>This step produces possible integers between 0 and 5. So next we add 1 to the
formula to get our desired possible results of 1-6.</p>

<p class="indented">   1 + (int) ( ( Math.random() ) * 6 )</p>

<h3>Loopy</h3>

<p>In programming, loops execute repetitive tasks. The “for” loop, the “while”
  loop, and the “do while” loop all function in slightly different ways.</p>

<p>The “for loop:</p>

<p>The “for” loop is used when you want a program to run a pre-determined number
of times, while the “while” and “do while” loop are event driven. A “for” loop
includes</p>
  <ol>
    <li>an initializer which tells the program when to start</li>
    <li>a conditional which tells the program when to end</li>
    <li>and an increment which tells the program how much to change by during each
  iteration</li>
  </ol>

<p>An example of when to use a “for” loop would be if you wanted someone to do
  something five times.</p>

<p>The “while” and “do while” loops:</p>

<p>In contrast to the count control aspect of the “for” loop, the “while” and
  “do while” loops execute their programs for as long as their condition is
  true. The key difference between these two event-driven loops is when the
  condition is introduced.</p>

<p>In the “while” loop, the condition is listed immediately. The computer checks
  the condition and, if true, it runs the loop. If false, it leaves the loop and
  moves on thru the code. Because of this format, the minimum number of times
  that a “while” loop will execute is zero. One example of where we might use a
  “while” loop would be in writing code for a point-accumulating dice game where
  rolling a 1 ends your turn. If the player rolls a 1 on their first turn, the
  while loop that adds points together doesn’t execute, no points are earned,
  and the player’s turn is over.</p>

<p>In the “do while” loop, the condition isn’t introduced until the end of the
loop. This format ensures that the loop runs at least one time before looking
to see if the condition is met. Printing a menu of options for a user to choose
from (possibly repeatedly) is one example of when a do while loop is useful.</p>

<p><h3>java.util.Scanner</h3></p>

<p>java.util.Scanner is a library reference. Scanner is a class that provides
  the functionality of being able to take input from a user. This functionality
  is located within the util (for utility) folder which is located within the
  java folder.</p>

<p>When you import java.util.Scanner, you are importing existing code into your
  program. This particular code allows you to take inputs from the user into
  your program.</p>
